# Day 1 

## Schematic Design 
### Design 

1. Design a simple symmetrical Inverter and NAND.
Note:
Use INV1X1 to name the inverter and A, VDD, GND, and Z for pin names
Use NAND2X1 to name the NAND gate A, B, VDD, GND and Z for pin names 

----

2. Create a symbol file. 

----

### Simulation

1. Transient Analysis
2. Dc Analysis
3. Parametric Analysis

### 


# Functional simulation 

simulate simple design [ counter, mux ] using cadence nclaunch 

# Synthesis

Synthesis you design using gpdk45 technology using Cadence Genus
